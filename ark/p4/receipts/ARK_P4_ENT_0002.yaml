  procedure:
    setup:
      - "Pattern injector: define 3 entropy bands (LOW <0.78, MID ~0.78, HIGH >0.78)"
      - "Measure E_HF at annulus detector + observe gate output (on/off)"
    steps:
      - "Play each pattern for N=100 frames; record E_HF distribution + gate state"
      - "Compute confusion matrix: expected PASS/BLOCK vs observed"
  acceptance:
    pass_if_all:
      - "All HIGH patterns PASS (>=99/100 frames each)"
      - "All LOW patterns BLOCK (>=99/100 frames each)"
      - "MID band shows transition around calibrated E_HF (document boundary)"
    fail_if_any:
      - "Gate leakage (LOW patterns pass frequently)"
      - "E_HF threshold unstable across repeats"
