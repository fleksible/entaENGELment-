  claims:
    - tag: "FACT"

      claim: "Entropy gating is enforced by a physical high-pass spectral filter."

      claim: "Acceptance: low-entropy calset scenes FAIL; high-entropy scenes PASS, with <= 2% false positives."

  procedure:
    calibration_assets:
      - "CALSET-ENT-LOW: monotone/striped patterns"
      - "CALSET-ENT-HIGH: fractal/noise textures"
    steps:
      - "Inject CALSET-ENT-LOW patterns at fixed illumination; record output power after filter."
      - "Inject CALSET-ENT-HIGH patterns at matched illumination; record output power after filter."
      - "Compute classification using filter output proxy (E_HF)."

  acceptance:
    pass_if_all:
      - "LOW set: >= 98% classified FAIL (blocked)."
      - "HIGH set: >= 98% classified PASS (transmit)."
      - "False positives <= 2% on LOW set."
