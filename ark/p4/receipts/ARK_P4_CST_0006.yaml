  test_case: "Continuous self-test — pilot tone with known patterns every 100 frames + crypto attestation"
  claims:
    - tag: SPEC
      reason_code: RC-AUD-TRACE
      claim: "Self-test runs every 100 frames using pilot tone with known patterns and logs cryptographic attestation."
      evidence_ref: "ark_cephalo_manifest_v2.json:validation.continuous_self_test"
  procedure:
    steps:
      - "Define pilot-pattern set P (small, fixed, hashed)"
      - "Inject P every 100 frames; measure expected guard outputs (Φ/H/JTC/τ/twin states)"
      - "Create attestation record: {frame_idx, outputs, hashes} signed by device key (or placeholder in P4)"
  acceptance:
    pass_if_all:
      - "self-test executed at correct cadence (±0 frames drift over 10k frames)"
      - "attestation log is complete and verifiable against hashes"
