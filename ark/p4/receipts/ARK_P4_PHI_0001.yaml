  test_case: "Φ* guard — saturable absorber intensity sweep validates physical threshold"
  component_under_test:
    name: "Φ* Guard"
    type: "saturable_absorber"
    enforcement: "absorb_if_below_threshold"

  claims:
    - tag: "FACT"
      reason_code: "RC-PHY-ENFORCE"
      claim: "Guard is implemented physically via saturable absorber transmission barrier."
      evidence_ref: "ark_cephalo_manifest_v2.json#/hardware_spec/layers/layer_1_optical_core/guards/phi_star_guard"

    - tag: "SPEC"
      reason_code: "RC-SPEC-THRESH"
      claim: "Constraint: Φ* >= 0.72; below threshold light is absorbed."
      evidence_ref: "ark_cephalo_manifest_v2.json#/governance_invariants/phi_star"

    - tag: "ACC"
      reason_code: "RC-CAL-MAP"
      claim: "Acceptance: threshold mapping matches ARK-MAP-PHI-0002 within ±0.02 Φ*."
      evidence_ref: "ark_cephalo_manifest_v2.json#/validation/calibration_protocol/phi_guard"

  procedure:
    setup:
      - "Use CALSET-PHI-0001 patterns for Φ* mapping calibration."
      - "Stabilize illumination; record baseline power."
    steps:
      - "Sweep incident intensity I from 0 → I_max across absorber (recommend 0..30 mW)."
      - "Record transmitted intensity T(I) and compute Φ* mapping per ARK-MAP-PHI-0002."
      - "Determine I_threshold where Φ* crosses 0.72."
      - "Repeat for >= 5 runs to estimate drift/hysteresis."

  acceptance:
    pass_if_all:
      - "I_threshold stable within ±0.02 Φ* equivalent across runs."
      - "Below threshold: transmission <= 15% (absorbed)."
      - "Above threshold: transmission >= 85% (saturates)."
